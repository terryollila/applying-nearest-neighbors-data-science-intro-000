    "\n",
    "In the last lesson we derived the nearest neighbor formula.  Nearest neighbors is a powerful algorithm because it allows us to predict other attributes about people using their proximity data.  For example, those who live in a particular neighborhood may be more likely to be a certain age or have similar interests.  Using proximity, we might even be able to determine whether their likelihood to purchase a product approximates that of their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll see how the nearest neighbors algorithm allows us to make predictions with data.  We will also look at the workflow for machine learning in general and see some of the common struggles that we experience when applying a machine learning algorithm. "

We already know that Bob actually purchased 52 cupcakes, so our formula is off by 8.  This number, our actual value minus the expected value, is called the **error**.  We can optimize the algorithm by adding all of the errors across all of the neighbors and selecting that `k` which minimizes this aggregate error for all of our data."

Data scientists cannot waste time waiting for new data to arrive, so they split their data in two: roughly 80 percent of the data for testing and 20 percent for training.  The training dataset is used for tweaking the algorithm, as we just saw, so that it minimizes the error or some other metric.  Once the algorithm is optimized, they study how well their algorithm performs on something it is not molded to, called test data.  If the algorithm performs well on this test data, it is ready for use and can make new predictions."

Underfitting occurs when our algorithm is not responsive enough to our data, and therefore we can optimize our algorithm to better predict our existing data.  Changing our algorithm so it responds to our data is called **training**.  **Overfitting** is the risk of training the algorithm to an existing data set to the extent that it picks up on the quirks of the data and fails to generalize to new data.  To prevent against overfitting, data scientists set aside a portion of the data for **testing** to determine if the algorithm properly can predict on this portion of the data. "
